Study looking at the persistence of an AMF biofertilizer in soil and effects on resident AMF

This study was conducted at two sites representing undisturbed natural Ponderosa Pine Grasslands in Kelowna BC (UBC Okanagan (UBCO), 49.93, -119.39), Knox Mountain Provincial Park (KM), 49.90, -119.48), British Columbia between 2012 and 2022. Site locations were selected based on similarity of soil characteristics (Table S2) and no evidence of the target R. irregularis isolate, DAOM 197198 using isolate specific primers described below (data not shown). <img width="468" height="158" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/853e7df9-8a0d-4b9d-a42d-83e12b8c8da2" />  Isolate was tracked over 13 years using isolate specific probes and ddPCR. Resident AMF was examined in soils with inoculant present/absent at year 13.
