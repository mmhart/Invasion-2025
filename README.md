Study tracking the persistence of a AMF (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) biofertlizer over 13 years. This study looks at the fate of an introduced AMF, Rhizophagus irregularis DAOM 197198 in natural systems and asks the questions:
•	Does it establish?
•	Does it persist over multiple growing seasons?
•	Does it matter what the host plant was?
•	Did uninoculated plants get colonized? When?
•	Did inoculation affect resident AMF after 13 years?

We planted 4 plants each at 5 sites within 2 blocks near Kelowna, BC Canada in 2013.  Plants were either inoculated in the greenhouse, or in the field.  Over four years, between 2014 and 2017 we took soil cores at 10, 25 and 50cm around the plants, extracted DNA before pooling by plant and measured inoculant abundance using primers specific to DAOM197198 and ddPCR.  In 2022 and 2025, we resampled remaining plots for inoculant abundance and looked at changes to resident AMF communities using Illumina Miseq (Wanda/AML2)(Dumbrell et al. 2011, Young and Lee 2009)(2025 only).
